I'm a passionate computer scientist, hacker and explorer. I love what I do with computers and I love what machines are: super-fast-fail boxes, in hand of super-lazy-geniuses.

# Skills
Here goes my skills, textual and graphs..
### Tech skills
My main area of interest about computer science is Web development. I'm fluent in major Web
stack technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and for heavy server side programming I'm
experienced in PHP. I'm passionate about good coding, software architectures and good
practices of software engineering.

I had my academic studies programming in Java, so I have a good forma mentis on Object
Oriented Programming principles. As a Web developer I always have concerns about security
issues and I'm interested in hacking in general (solving problems not with known, standard
methods, but with creativity and always searching for new knowledge).

To build blogs, business and enterprise websites I use Wordpress.

To build Web apps I used Yii (PHP) and Sails.js (Node.js), both with SQL (MySQL) or NoSQL
(MongoDB) solutions.

To manage project's source code I love to use Git and GitHub (for open source projects).

To build responsive Web interfaces I use Twitter's Bootstrap combined with LESS, a CSS
pre-processor that allow developers to write CSS that is more maintainable and extendable.

I studied machine learning and data mining, subjects that I'm a lot interested in.
